# Project Overview: AI Experiments

This directory is a personal workspace for a variety of AI-related projects, experiments, and learning materials. It is not a single, unified project, but rather a collection of independent scripts and notes.

## Directory Contents

The directory is organized into several subdirectories, each containing a specific project or set of resources. The key areas of focus are:

*   **Web Scraping**: Several projects are dedicated to scraping data from websites, particularly for job listings.
    *   `a_scrapper`: A basic web scraper using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
    *   `nvda_scrapper`: A script to scrape job listings from NVIDIA's Workday site.
    *   `scrapper_exp`: A more advanced scraper for LinkedIn jobs using `Selenium`.
*   **AI Agent Development**: There are projects and notes related to building and using AI agents.
    *   `adk-python-dev`: A project using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).
    *   `claude`: Configuration and notes for using the Claude desktop app with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **AI/ML Learning**: The workspace contains materials for learning about AI and machine learning.
    *   `courses`: A curated list of online courses on AI, ML, and related topics.
    *   `hugging_face_exp`: Experiments and notebooks related to Hugging Face models.
    *   `gpt_exp`: A placeholder for experiments with GPT models.
*   **Utility Scripts**:
    *   `cv_updater`: A Python script to automatically tailor a CV to a specific job description.
*   **Prompt Engineering**:
    *   `prompt`: A collection of prompts for use with large language models.

## Key Files and Projects

*   **`README.md`**: The main `README.md` file provides a high-level overview of the projects and a to-do list of future ideas.
*   **`cv_updater/cv_updater.py`**: A useful script for job seekers that customizes a CV based on a job description.
*   **`scrapper_exp/linkedin_job_scraper.py`**: A practical example of using Selenium for web scraping.
*   **`adk-python-dev/my_agent/agent.py`**: The entry point for an AI agent built with the Google ADK.
*   **`courses/README.md`**: A valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about AI and machine learning.

## Usage

This directory is a personal workspace and the projects within it are at various stages of development. To run a specific project, navigate to its subdirectory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file, if one is available. Many of the Python scripts will require installing dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file or as listed in the `README.md`.
