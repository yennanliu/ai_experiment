Great! To learn AI concepts like LLMs (Large Language Models), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and AI agents, you can follow this structured approach:

1. Foundations of AI & ML
	‚Ä¢	Learn Python (if you haven‚Äôt already) since it‚Äôs the primary language for AI.
	‚Ä¢	Study Machine Learning (ML) basics:
	‚Ä¢	Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Use online courses like Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning on Coursera.
	‚Ä¢	Get comfortable with Deep Learning concepts:
	‚Ä¢	Neural networks, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs.
	‚Ä¢	Study Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.
	‚Ä¢	Use PyTorch or TensorFlow for hands-on practice.

2. Understanding LLMs
	‚Ä¢	Learn about Transformer models (the architecture behind LLMs):
	‚Ä¢	Read ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù (Transformer paper).
	‚Ä¢	Study Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers library.
	‚Ä¢	Try OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models, Google‚Äôs Gemini, or Meta‚Äôs LLaMA.
	‚Ä¢	Experiment with LLMs using APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).

3. Learning RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
	‚Ä¢	Understand Vector Databases (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate, Pinecone).
	‚Ä¢	Learn how LLMs retrieve information dynamically from external sources.
	‚Ä¢	Follow tutorials on building RAG applications (e.g., with LangChain).

4. Learning AI Agents
	‚Ä¢	Study Reinforcement Learning (RL) basics.
	‚Ä¢	Learn about Autonomous AI Agents using frameworks like LangChain Agents, Auto-GPT, BabyAGI.
	‚Ä¢	Experiment with multi-agent systems (e.g., OpenAI‚Äôs AutoGPT, CrewAI).

5. Hands-on Projects
	‚Ä¢	Fine-tune an LLM on custom data.
	‚Ä¢	Build a RAG-based chatbot using LangChain & FAISS.
	‚Ä¢	Create an AI Agent that automates tasks.

6. Advanced Topics
	‚Ä¢	Read AI research papers on arXiv, Hugging Face blogs.
	‚Ä¢	Follow AI YouTube channels like AI Coffee Break with Letitia, Two Minute Papers.
	‚Ä¢	Join AI communities (Reddit, Discord, Twitter).
