## Content Best Practices

### Writing Achievement Bullets

**Formula: Action Verb + Task + Technology + Measurable Result**

**Examples:**

✓ GOOD:
- "Optimized database queries using PostgreSQL and Redis caching, reducing API response time by 60% and improving throughput from 100 to 400 requests/second"
- "Led migration of monolithic application to microservices architecture using Kubernetes and Docker, reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes and improving system reliability to 99.99% uptime"
- "Designed and implemented real-time data pipeline processing 10M+ events/day using Kafka and Spark, enabling data-driven decisions that increased user engagement by 25%"

✗ BAD:
- "Worked on database optimization"
- "Helped with migration project"
- "Responsible for data pipeline"

### Quantifiable Metrics to Include

**Performance:**
- Response time improvements (ms, seconds)
- Throughput increases (requests/second, transactions/day)
- Latency reductions
- System uptime/reliability percentages

**Scale:**
- Number of users impacted
- Data volume processed
- Traffic handled
- System capacity

**Business Impact:**
- Cost savings (dollars, percentage)
- Revenue generated or influenced
- Efficiency gains (time saved, automation hours)
- User engagement increases

**Code Quality:**
- Test coverage percentages
- Bug reduction rates
- Code review metrics
- Deployment frequency

**Team Impact:**
