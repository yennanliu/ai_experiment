## What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that operate with their own context windows and specific expertise. They help manage complex tasks by delegating to focused, purpose-built agents.

### Key Benefits

- **Separate Context**: Each subagent maintains its own context window, preventing information overload
- **Specialized Expertise**: Custom system prompts for specific domains
- **Tool Restrictions**: Limit access to only necessary tools for security and focus
- **Parallelization**: Run multiple subagents concurrently for complex workflows
- **Reusability**: Define once, invoke many times
- **Context Efficiency**: Don't pollute main conversation with specialized work

### How They Differ from Custom Commands

| Feature | Custom Commands | Subagents |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Context | Shares main context | Separate context window |
| Complexity | Simple prompts | Complex, stateful tasks |
| Tools | Inherits all tools | Configurable tool access |
| System Prompt | No custom system prompt | Custom system prompt |
| Best For | Quick prompts | Specialized workflows |

## Setup and Structure

### Directory Structure

```bash
# Project-level subagents (version controlled, shared with team)
.claude/agents/

# User-level subagents (local to your machine)
~/.claude/agents/

# Priority: Project-level > User-level
```

### Subagent File Format

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When and why to use this subagent
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Bash
model: inherit
---

Your system prompt goes here.

This defines the subagent's:
- Personality and expertise
- Approach to problems
- Output format
- Constraints and guidelines
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier | `code-reviewer` |
| `description` | Yes | When to use this agent | `Expert code review specialist` |
| `tools` | No | Allowed tools (comma-separated) | `Read, Grep, Glob` |
| `model` | No | Model to use | `inherit`, `sonnet`, `opus` |

## Tool Configuration

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Read-Only |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `Read` | Read files | Yes |
| `Write` | Create new files | No |
| `Edit` | Modify existing files | No |
| `Grep` | Search file contents | Yes |
| `Glob` | Find files by pattern | Yes |
| `Bash` | Execute shell commands | No |
| `Task` | Delegate to other subagents | No |
| `WebFetch` | Fetch web content | Yes |
| `WebSearch` | Search the internet | Yes |

### Tool Restriction Examples

```markdown
# Read-only subagent (for analysis/review)
---
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Code modifier (can edit but not create)
---
tools: Read, Edit, Grep, Glob
---

# Full access (can create, modify, run commands)
---
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

# Research-focused
---
tools: Read, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch
---

# Testing specialist
---
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
---
```

### Security Considerations

```markdown
# Dangerous: Full access to everything
---
tools: all
---

# Better: Explicit tool list
---
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob
---

# Best: Minimal necessary tools
---
tools: Read, Grep
---
```

---

## Invocation Methods

### Method 1: Automatic Delegation

Claude automatically delegates to subagents based on task description.

```bash
# Claude sees "review" and uses code-reviewer subagent
Review the authentication logic in @src/auth.js

# Claude sees "optimize" and uses performance-optimizer
This function is slow, can you optimize it? @src/utils.js

# Claude sees "test" and uses test-generator
Create tests for @src/api/users.js
```

**When it works well:**
- Subagent descriptions clearly match task types
- Only one subagent matches the task
- Task description contains keywords from subagent description

### Method 2: Explicit Invocation

Directly specify which subagent to use.

```bash
# Explicit by name
Use the code-reviewer subagent to analyze @src/app.js

# Explicit with context
Use security-auditor to check @src/api/ for vulnerabilities

# Chain multiple subagents
Use code-architect to design the system, then use doc-writer to document it
```

**When to use explicit:**
- Multiple subagents could handle the task
- Want specific subagent's approach
- Testing a new subagent
- Task doesn't clearly match subagent description

### Method 3: Interactive Selection

Use the `/agents` command to list and select subagents.

```bash
# List available subagents
/agents

# Create new subagent interactively
/agents
# Follow prompts to configure
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Single Responsibility

```markdown
# Good: Focused purpose
---
name: security-auditor
description: Performs security audits only
---

# Bad: Multiple responsibilities
---
name: code-helper
description: Reviews code, writes tests, fixes bugs, and generates docs
---
```

### 2. Detailed System Prompts

```markdown
# Good: Comprehensive instructions
---
name: test-generator
---

You are a TDD expert specializing in Jest.

Your process:
1. Analyze the code structure
2. Identify all public methods
3. Create test cases for:
   - Happy paths
   - Edge cases (null, undefined, empty, boundary values)
   - Error conditions
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Follow AAA pattern
6. Use descriptive test names

Test naming convention:
"should [expected behavior] when [condition]"

Always include setup and teardown.
Target 90%+ code coverage.

# Bad: Vague instructions
---
name: test-generator
---

Create good tests.
```

### 3. Appropriate Tool Access

```markdown
# Review agent: read-only
---
name: code-reviewer
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Fix agent: can modify
---
name: bug-fixer
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

# Test agent: can create and run
---
name: test-generator
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
---
```

### 4. Version Control Project Subagents

```bash
# Commit project subagents
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m "Add code-reviewer and test-generator subagents"

# Ignore user-specific subagents
echo ".claude/agents/personal-*" >> .gitignore
```

### 5. Clear Descriptions

```markdown
# Good: Clear when to use
---
description: Reviews code for bugs, security, and best practices
---

# Bad: Vague
---
description: Helps with code
---

# Good: Specific expertise
---
description: Optimizes database queries and schema design
---

# Bad: Too broad
---
description: Database expert
---
```

### 6. Consistent Output Formats

```markdown
# Define structure in system prompt
---
---

Always output in this format:

## Summary
Brief overview

## Findings
Detailed findings

## Recommendations
Actionable suggestions

## Next Steps
What to do next
```

### 7. Testing Subagents

```bash
# Create test subagent
cat > .claude/agents/echo-test.md << 'EOF'
---
name: echo-test
description: Test subagent that echoes input
tools: Read
---

You are a test subagent. Echo back what you're asked to do and list the files you can see.
EOF

# Test it
# In Claude Code: Use echo-test to verify @src/app.js

# Remove when done
rm .claude/agents/echo-test.md
```

---

## Complete Real-World Example

Let's create a complete subagent setup for a development team:

```bash
# 1. Create agents directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# 2. Create code reviewer
cat > .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md << 'EOF'
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, bugs, and best practices
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
---

You are an expert code reviewer.

Review for:
1. Bugs and logic errors
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Performance issues
4. Code quality and maintainability
5. Best practices adherence

Provide specific, actionable feedback with line references.
EOF

# 3. Create test generator
cat > .claude/agents/test-generator.md << 'EOF'
---
name: test-generator
description: Generates comprehensive test suites
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
---

You are a TDD expert.

Generate tests with:
- Happy path coverage
- Edge case testing
- Error handling verification
- Mocked dependencies
- 80%+ code coverage

Follow existing test patterns in the project.
EOF

# 4. Create documentation writer
cat > .claude/agents/doc-writer.md << 'EOF'
---
name: doc-writer
description: Creates clear technical documentation
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
---

You are a technical writer.

Create documentation with:
- Clear overview
- Code examples
- API references
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting section

Use active voice and simple language.
EOF

# 5. Create bug fixer
cat > .claude/agents/bug-fixer.md << 'EOF'
---
name: bug-fixer
description: Systematically debugs and fixes issues
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
---

You are a systematic debugger.

Your process:
1. Reproduce the bug
2. Analyze root cause
3. Propose fix
4. Implement fix
5. Verify solution
6. Check for regressions

Always explain the root cause and prevention.
EOF

# 6. Commit to version control
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m "Add development subagents: reviewer, tester, doc-writer, bug-fixer"

# 7. Use in workflow
# In Claude Code:
# - "Review @src/app.js" → Uses code-reviewer
# - "Create tests for @src/utils.js" → Uses test-generator
# - "Document @src/api.js" → Uses doc-writer
# - "Fix bug in @src/auth.js:42" → Uses bug-fixer
```

## Troubleshooting

### Subagent Not Found

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Check filename matches name in frontmatter
cat .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md | head -n 5

# Verify YAML syntax
# Should be:
# ---
# name: code-reviewer
# description: ...
# ---
```

### Subagent Not Being Used Automatically

```markdown
# Make description more specific
---
# Bad: Too vague
description: Helps with code

# Good: Clear triggers
description: Reviews code for bugs and security issues
---

# Use explicit invocation instead
Use the code-reviewer subagent to analyze @src/app.js
```

### Wrong Tools Available

```markdown
# Check tools configuration
---
tools: Read, Write, Grep  # Comma-separated, no quotes
---

# Not:
# tools: "Read, Write, Grep"  # ❌
# tools: [Read, Write, Grep]  # ❌
```

### Subagent Context Too Large

```markdown
# Limit tools to reduce context
---
# Instead of:
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task

# Use only what's needed:
tools: Read, Grep
---
```

### Testing Subagent Behavior

```bash
# Create minimal test case
cat > .claude/agents/test-agent.md << 'EOF'
---
name: test-agent
description: Test agent for debugging
tools: Read
---

You are a test agent. Simply describe what you're asked to do and what tools you have access to.
EOF

# Use it explicitly
# In Claude Code: Use test-agent to check behavior

# Remove when done
rm .claude/agents/test-agent.md
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Creating a Subagent

```bash
# 1. Create directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# 2. Create subagent file
cat > .claude/agents/name.md << 'EOF'
---
name: agent-name
description: What it does and when to use it
tools: Read, Write, Bash
model: inherit
---

System prompt defining expertise and behavior.
EOF

# 3. Test it
# In Claude Code: Use agent-name to [task]
```

### Subagent Template

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Clear description of purpose and when to use
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
---

You are a [role] specializing in [expertise].
