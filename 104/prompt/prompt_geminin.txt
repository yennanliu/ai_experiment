(free to chose option A or B)

### Refined Logic & Prompts

#### Option A: The "All-in-One" Technical Instruction

Use this if your MCP environment allows for complex, multi-step scripts.

> **Prompt:** > "Using the Playwright MCP, automate the job application process on 104 Job Bank with the following logic:
> 1. **Navigate** to the search results page: `https://www.104.com.tw/jobs/search/?page=6&keyword=軟體工程師&jobsource=joblist_search&order=15&remoteWork=1,2&area=6001001000,6001002000`
> 2. **Iterate** through all job listings on the current page:
> * Click on each job link (open in a new tab or same page).
> * Locate the **'Apply' (我要應徵)** button and click it.
> * In the application modal/page, select the recommendation letter template named **'自動推薦信1'**.
> * Click **'Submit' (送出應徵)**.
> * Close the job page/modal to return to the list.
> 
> 
> 3. **Pagination:** Once all jobs on the page are processed, find and click the 'Next Page' button.
> 4. **Repeat** the process until all pages are completed or a specific limit is reached.
> 5. **Error Handling:** If a job has already been applied to, skip it and move to the next."

#### Option B: The "Modular" Approach (Recommended)

Automation often breaks due to unexpected pop-ups. It is better to ask the AI to write a **Playwright script** first, which you can then run or have the MCP execute.

**Step 1: Scrape & List**

> "Write a Playwright script to navigate to the 104 search URL and extract the URLs of all job postings on the page that do not have the 'Already Applied' status."

**Step 2: Apply Logic**

> "For each extracted URL, create a function that:
> * Navigates to the job page.
> * Clicks '我要應徵'.
> * Selects '自動推薦信1' from the dropdown or radio list.
> * Clicks the final submit button.
> * Handles the 'Success' confirmation pop-up."
