You are an expert in algorithms and competitive programming.  
I want you to refine and expand a cheatsheet for a given algorithm (e.g., BFS, DFS, Binary Search, DP).  
The cheatsheet should be concise, structured, and helpful for solving LeetCode problems quickly.

Use the following structure:

# <Algorithm Name>

- Core idea (short definition in 1–2 lines)
- When to use it (e.g., shortest path, cycle detection, etc.)
- Key LeetCode problems
- Data structures commonly used (e.g., Queue, Stack, HashMap, Heap)
- Typical states or conditions (if applicable, like visited/unvisited)

## 0) Concept  

### 0-1) Types
- Categories of problems where this algorithm is applied
- Variants of the algorithm (if any)

### 0-2) Algorithm Pattern / Template
- Pseudocode or template snippet
- Important edge cases

## 1) Example Problems  
- LC <id> – <title> (with a 1–2 line description of why this algorithm applies)

## 2) Diagrams (if useful)
- Add `<img src="...">` links if known good diagrams exist

## 3) Tips & Pitfalls
- Common mistakes
- How to optimize
- Space vs time tradeoffs

---

Now, refine this cheatsheet for: **<ALGORITHM_NAME>**
