Given a LeetCode problem (for example: Group Anagrams), give me a list of similar problems that use the same pattern, solving trick, or data structure.
Order the recommendations from basic â†’ medium â†’ hard, so I can practice step by step.
For each recommended problem, briefly explain what makes it similar.

ðŸ”¹ Example (input = Group Anagrams)

Similar Problems (basic â†’ mid â†’ hard):
	â€¢	Easy:
	â€¢	Valid Anagram (242) â†’ Checks if two strings are anagrams (basic frequency counting).
	â€¢	Medium:
	â€¢	Find All Anagrams in a String (438) â†’ Sliding window + frequency map.
	â€¢	Group Shifted Strings (249) â†’ Similar grouping trick, hashing by pattern.
	â€¢	Hard:
	â€¢	Palindrome Pairs (336) â†’ Advanced hashing + grouping words by properties.
	â€¢	Substring with Concatenation of All Words (30) â†’ Hashmap + string window grouping.
