**Prompt:**
Hi ChatGPT, let's do a pair programming session focused on AI engineering. I want to work through these steps together:

1. Train or load a machine learning model (you can suggest the dataset and model type).
2. Follow ML best practices during the process (data preprocessing, validation, reproducibility, etc.).
3. Explain relevant knowledge about the model architecture, LLM foundations, or ML concepts as we proceed.
4. Offer suggestions on improving the model or the code, including debugging, optimization, or new ideas.
5. Leverage popular ML tools and frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, Google Gemini, MCP) to enhance development and deployment.
6. Leverage new LLM-specific tools or techniques to improve performance or integration.

Let's start with training or loading the model â€” please guide me step by step.
