# Dark Mode Feature

## Overview
Add a dark mode toggle to the Notes application that allows users to switch between light and dark color themes. The theme preference should persist across browser sessions, providing a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions
- As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered so that I don't have to switch it every time I open the app
- As a user, I want an easily accessible toggle button so that I can quickly switch themes when needed
- As a user, I want the theme to apply to all parts of the application so that the experience is consistent

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A theme toggle button is visible in the application header
- [ ] Clicking the toggle switches between light and dark themes
- [ ] The dark theme applies appropriate colors to all UI elements (background, text, borders, etc.)
- [ ] The theme preference is saved to localStorage
- [ ] The saved theme preference is loaded automatically on app startup
- [ ] The theme switch is smooth without page reload
- [ ] All text remains readable in both themes (proper contrast ratios)
- [ ] Icons and buttons are styled appropriately for both themes

## Technical Considerations
- **State Management**: Use React Context or localStorage for theme state
- **CSS Strategy**: Use Tailwind's dark mode classes or CSS variables
- **Performance**: Theme switching should be instant (<100ms)
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios in both themes
- **Browser Support**: localStorage is available in all modern browsers
- **No Backend Changes**: This is purely a frontend feature
- **Persistence**: Use localStorage with key like 'notes-app-theme'

## Success Metrics
- Users can successfully toggle between themes
- Theme preference persists across browser sessions
- No visual glitches during theme switching
- All UI elements are properly styled in both themes
- User feedback indicates improved usability

## Out of Scope
- Multiple theme options (only light and dark)
- System theme detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Custom theme colors
- Theme scheduling (auto-switch at certain times)
- Server-side theme storage
