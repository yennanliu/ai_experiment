## Analysis Summary

**No Backend Changes Required** ✅

The dark mode toggle feature is entirely a frontend implementation. Here's why no backend API is needed:

### Current Implementation Approach
1. **Client-Side Storage**: Theme preference stored in browser's `localStorage`
2. **No User Authentication**: Requirements specify no authentication system exists
3. **Local State Management**: Theme state managed in frontend application state
4. **CSS-Based Rendering**: Visual changes handled through CSS variables or classes

### What This Means for the Team
- **Backend Team**: No work required - this feature does not touch the API layer
- **Frontend Team**: Full ownership of implementation using client-side technologies
- **Testing**: Can be tested entirely in the browser without backend dependencies
- **Deployment**: Frontend-only deployment, no backend coordination needed

### Future Backend Integration Points
If the application evolves, these scenarios would require API changes:
1. **User Profiles**: Storing preference server-side for cross-device sync
2. **Analytics**: Tracking theme usage patterns for product insights
3. **A/B Testing**: Server-controlled theme defaults for different user segments

For the current POC scope with no authentication system, the backend remains completely unchanged.
